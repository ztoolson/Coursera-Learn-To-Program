    The Problem:

    Write a function that has three parameters
        -a restaurant file that is open for reading
        -the price range(one of $, $$, $$$, or $$$$)
        -list of cuisines
    It returns a list of restaurants (in that price range, serving at least one
    of those cuisines) and their ratings sorted from highest to lowest.
    '''

##    PLANNING THE PROGRAM
##    Keep track of restaurant rating using a dictionary
##        - key = resaurant anem
##        - value = percent recommended
    # dict{str: int}
    name_to_rating = {'Georgie Porgie': 87,
    'Queen St. Cafe': 82,
    'Mexican Grill': 85,
    'Deep Fried Everything': 52}

##    Make list of the restaurents based on $
    # dict of {str: list of str}
    price_to_names = {'$': ['Queen St. Cafe', 'Dumplings R Us', 'Deep Fried Everything'],
    '$$': ['Mexican Grill'],
    '$$$': ['Georgie Porgie'],
    '$$$$': []}

##    List of each type of food
    # dict{str: list of str]}
    cuisine_to_names = {'Canadian': ['Georgie Porgie'],
    'Pub Food': ['Georgie Porgie', 'Deep Fried Everything'],
    'Malaysian': ['Queen St. Cafe'],
    'Thai': ['Queen St. Cafe'],
    'Chinese': ['Dumplings R Us'],
    'Mexican': ['Mexican Grill'] }
